# Gbiv Documentation Guide


## Proposal

This document details our original project proposal. It contains a shortened version of the Gbiv SRS and SDS, along with a page describing the general project timeline and division of labor.


## SRS

In this directory, you will find source files and a pdf build of the system requirements specification for Gbiv. This describes the requirements for our project including a concept of operations and more specific system requirements.


## SDS

In this folder we have the reStructuredText files that were used to generate the system design specification as well as a pdf version of the document. Here we have a more comprehensive outline of the software architecture as well as design details for specific modules.


## Tech Used and Acknowledgments

Much of the documentation for this project has been written in reStructuredText and compiled into pdf form using the Sphinx documentation generator. For more information on these tools see the links below:
