Format of Inputs and Outputs
==============================

The photos you upload to Gbiv must be in the standardized image formats of .jpg, .jpeg, or .png so that they can be interpreted by the system.

The output of Gbiv is solely composed of colors. When using the application, you will be able to see the colors visually, but also be able to get the hex codes that correspond to the colors displayed. 

Hex color codes are a way of classifying the colors used on the web. They come in the form of a 6 character code with a pound symbol (#) in front of it. This system of defining colors is used extensively in web development, but is also recognized in a variety of other domains such as commercial paint and printing.
