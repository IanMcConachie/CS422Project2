Overview of The Application
=============================

Gbiv is a web application created for the designer in all of us. Design is everywhere--from the clothes you put on in the morning to the building you live in--and an essential part of all design is color. Our application provides a powerful tool for utilizing color theory when making design decisions. 

In the digital space there are color classification systems structured around color theory principles, but in the physical world we often lack such convenience. Gbiv bridges this gap by allowing users to upload images of physical objects and extract the primary color of what is pictured. It then goes a step further by performing automated design analysis and suggesting related colors and palettes. This lets everyone, whether they are professionals or beginners, utilize the power of color theory in their everyday life.

Have you ever been painting your house and needed to match a new color to the existing color scheme? Do you ever find yourself wondering what color of pants match with your new sweater? Or maybe you are at the furniture store and can't figure out if a couch would "fit" with your living room chair? All of these are situations where Gbiv can save the day.


Beyond this primary functionality, Gbiv offers several other services to support end-users. This includes providing example palettes for design inspiration and giving information about color theory principles so that users can understand the science behind Gbiv's recommendations.
