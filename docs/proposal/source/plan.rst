Rough Timeline of Work
------------------------


**Week 1 (Nov 7-13)**

(Frontend and Backend): Create project with placeholder/dummy functions and features; integrate frontend and backend before major development; get web hosting set up.


**Week 2 (Nov 14-20)**

Frontend: Get placeholder sections on the web page configured; start making functions to handle backend requests; if web hosting is not done yet, get it done. 

Backend: 1: Crete modules for simple extraction of dominant colors as well as finding complementary colors given a color. 2: Establish the structure of databases/collections in MongoDB and begin establishing methods for querying palettes based on other colors.


**Week 3 (Nov 21-27)**

Frontend: Design the web page sections cohesively; perhaps begin testing integration.


Backend: 1: Implement palette querying, potentially reconfigure database/collection hierarchy to optimize query times and facilitate the most common searches between palettes. 2: Start producing the filtering methods necessary to provide the color palette selection functionality. 3: Flesh out color extraction modules and fully connect them to the database (s•t• colors are extracted from pictures and uploaded to the correct collection).


**Week 4 (Nov 28-Dec 2)**

Frontend: Polish web page sections; ensure that all functions are working as expected.


Backend: Finalize filtering methods necessary to allow for users to look for palettes related manually (i.e., without uploading any images).
