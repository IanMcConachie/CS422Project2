Dynamic Models of Operational Scenarios
========================================

There are two use cases that were described in the system requirements specification for Gbiv. These two cases demonstrate the dynamics of the application well, but it should be noted that not pictured here are the ways in which Gbiv can be used simply for information (about color theory or the project). These use cases matter to the application, but require little to no interfacing with the user and between modules, so they are not described below.


The first use case for Gbiv can be seen as the main attraction of our application. It describes how users can upload an image and have Gbiv extract the dominant color and make color suggestions in response to that dominant color. The diagram below (:numref:`use-case-1`) shows the operational scenario visually in terms of user interaction, as well as interaction between modules in the system.

The next operational scenario we will show in this section shows how users can view palettes through our example palettes page. The diagram below (:numref:`use-case-2`) gives a succinct visual representation of how the system is able to fulfill this use case.
