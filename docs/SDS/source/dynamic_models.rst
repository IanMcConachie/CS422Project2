Dynamic Models of Operational Scenarios
========================================

There is a single use case for Gbiv which is described in the SRS.  However, it should be noted that our application has functionality beyond this in the form of providing information. The information given on the sample palettes, color theory, and about us pages is essential, but requires little to no interfacing with the user and between modules, so they are not described below.


Our use case describes how users can upload an image and have Gbiv extract the dominant color and make color suggestions in response to that dominant color. The diagram below (:numref:`use-case-1`) shows the operational scenario visually in terms of user interaction, as well as interaction within the system.
