<h2 class="sub-title">What is Color Theory?</h2>
<p class="expl-txt">
Color theory is the thought process behind putting colors together for a design based on the
color wheel. It explains how we as humans view color and the effects of mixing colors 
together. That being said, color theory is relevant in many fields that involve visual 
communication such as marketing,art, graphic design, and etc. A very simple example
would be putting light colored text over a dark background to make things legible
for the user or reader.

<h2 class="sub-title">Isaac Newton and Color Theory</h2>
<p class="expl-txt">
	Sir Isaac Newton played a significant role in creating color theory. He put colors into three groups: primary, secondary and tertiary. Primary colors are red, blue and yellow. Secondary colors are those produced when mixing primary colors together. An example would be green which is made by blue and yellow. Lastly, tertiary is the mix of the primary and secondary colors. Examples would be blue-green, blue-violet, red-orange, etc.

<h2 class="sub-title">Color properties</h2>
<p class="expl-txt">
	There are three important properties that colors have. The first one is hue, which is how the color appears. The second one is chroma which  indicates if there are any shades or tints added.  Lastly, there is lighting, which indicated the saturation of the color. 
</p>

<p class="expl-txt">
	Knowing about the different groups of colors, how they mix, and the properties of colors are an essential part of UX design, art and marketing.
