What is Color Theory?
Color theory is the collection of rules and guidelines which designers use 
to communicate with users through appealing color schemes in visual 
interfaces. To pick the best colors every time, designers use a color 
wheel and refer to extensive collected knowledge about human optical 
ability, psychology, culture and more.


“Color! What a deep and mysterious language, the language of dreams.”
— Paul Gauguin, Famous post-Impressionist painter


Color is in the Beholders’ Eyes
Sir Isaac Newton established color theory when he invented the color 
wheel in 1666. Newton understood colors as human perceptions—not absolute 
qualities—of wavelengths of light. By systematically categorizing colors, 
he defined three groups:


Primary (red, blue, yellow)

Secondary (mixes of primary colors)

Tertiary (or intermediate – mixes of primary and secondary colors)


Following Newton’s findings, the study of color advanced to cover the 
properties of color in its two forms—i.e., print/paint and screen/light—and
in a variety of fields, from art to astronomy. A color’s properties are:


Hue – How it appears (e.g., “is green”).

Chroma – How pure it is: i.e., if it has shades (black added), tints (white added) or tones (grey added).

Lighting – How pale or saturated it appears.


In user experience (UX) design, you need a firm grasp of color theory to
craft harmonious, meaningful designs for your users.

    Design and color theory are everywhere from web development to fashion to interior design and architecture. No
    existing site has the functionality of our application which provides a powerful tool for applying color theory to the real
    world. We often have physical items such as paint, clothes, or furniture where we cannot simply check the hex code of
    the dominant color. 
    Our application combines this analysis of the color in terms of hex along with recommendations
    for colors to combine it with based on color theory.
